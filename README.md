# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game runs in the command line interface and allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Shivani-Chauhan-Dev/tic_tac_toe/tree/main
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Enter the cloned directory.

    ```bash
    cd tic_tac_toe
    ```

3. **Run the Game:** Execute the Python script to start the game.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Play the Game:** Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Players take turns entering the row and column numbers where they want to place their mark (e.g., "1 2" to place a mark in the first row, second column).

5. **Winning:** The game automatically detects when a player wins by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three marks. If all positions are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

6. **Play Again:** After the game ends, players can choose to play again or exit the game.
